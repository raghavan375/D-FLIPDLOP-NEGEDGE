# D-FLIPDLOP-NEGEDGE

**AIM:**

To implement  D flipflop using verilog and validating their functionality using their functional tables

**SOFTWARE REQUIRED:**

Quartus prime

**THEORY**

**D Flip-Flop**

D flip-flop operates with only positive clock transitions or negative clock transitions. Whereas, D latch operates with enable signal. That means, the output of D flip-flop is insensitive to the changes in the input, D except for active transition of the clock signal. The circuit diagram of D flip-flop is shown in the following figure.

This circuit has single input D and two outputs Qtt & Qtt’. The operation of D flip-flop is similar to D Latch. But, this flip-flop affects the outputs only when positive transition of the clock signal is applied instead of active enable. The following table shows the state table of D flip-flop.

Therefore, D flip-flop always Hold the information, which is available on data input, D of earlier positive transition of clock signal. From the above state table, we can directly write the next state equation as Qt+1t+1 = D

Next state of D flip-flop is always equal to data input, D for every positive transition of the clock signal. Hence, D flip-flops can be used in registers, shift registers and some of the counters.

**Procedure**

1.Define Module: Define a Verilog module for the D flip-flop with inputs (D, CLK) and outputs (Q, Q_bar).

2.Declare Inputs and Outputs: Declare input and output ports for the module.

3.Implement Flip-Flop Logic: Write Verilog code to implement the D flip-flop logic based on its functional table. Use a synchronous always @(posedge CLK) block to trigger the flip-flop on the positive edge of the clock signal.

4.Simulate Using Testbench: Write a Verilog testbench to simulate the behavior of the D flip-flop under different input conditions.

5.Apply Input Stimuli: In the testbench, apply various combinations of input stimuli (D, CLK) to cover all possible input states.

6.Verify Output Behavior: Verify that the output behavior of the D flip-flop matches the expected behavior defined by its functional table.

7.Check for Race Conditions: Ensure that there are no race conditions or undefined states in the design by analyzing the timing and sequence of input changes.


**PROGRAM**

Program for flipflops and verify its truth table in quartus using Verilog programming. 

    module d_ff_neg_edge (d, clk, rst, q);
      input d, clk, rst;
      output reg q;

      always @(negedge clk or posedge rst) begin
        if (rst)
          q <= 0; // Reset the flip-flop
        else
          q <= d; // D input is passed to Q on the negative clock edge
      end
    endmodule
